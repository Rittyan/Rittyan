I'm a Japanese software engineer with 5+ years experience in backend, Infrastructure and frontend. Finding and solving problems is my passion. To that end, I'm constantly learning about new technologies and tools. I mainly used PHP, JS, and Ruby at work, but I can use Java, C++ and Rust as well. I have not only coding skills but also software development skills such as introducing CI, leading a team of three, and reviewing code. In 2019 - 2020, I was in MSc Advanced computer science at University of St.Andrews.
