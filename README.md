# Summary                                                     
Software developer with 5+ years experience in backend, IT Infrastructure, and frontend development.
The most important thing which I'm looking for is something that is fun.
I would like to work in a small team where I can influence things and have some freedom.
I am interested in to find and solve problems, and learning new technologies and tools.
